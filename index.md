Welcome to our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://muc2021.mensch-und-computer.de">Mensch und Computer</a> workshop on Interaction in Public Spaces:
Aesthetics, Social Acceptability, and Social Context. We want to bring together
HCI researchers and UX practitioners to explore some of the largely untouched
questions of positive technology interaction in social spaces. These include:

* How do social contexts and social acceptability shape user experiences?
* What potentials for positive experiences can we find in the social world?
* How does interaction design impact social experiences?
* How can we include social context in design processes to create better
  things?

We invite both experts and novices to join us and learn together (see [how to
participate](/aips/participate.html)). If you already have some experience
designing or researching technology for social contexts, we want to hear what
you have to say! As a novice, you can bring your questions or use cases, or
just get inspired by others' projects. In addition, we share our own work and
currently reach out to an external **keynote** speaker (to be announced).

Will it happen online? Will we meet in Ingolstadt? Well, we don't know yet, but
we prepare for both scenarios. Here are some information we do already know:

Application Deadline: 21.05.2021

Dates of the Conference: 05.-08.09.2021

We are looking forward to your contributions! If in doubt, don't hesitate to
[reach out to us](/aips/contact.html).
