Welcome to our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="https://muc2021.mensch-und-computer.de">Mensch und Computer</a> workshop
on Interaction in Public Spaces: Aesthetics, Social Acceptability, and Social
Context. We want to bring together HCI researchers and UX practitioners to
discuss the role of "the social" in current design approaches, and to develop
new directions for the future. The topics we would like to talk about include:

* How does interaction design shape social experiences?
* More generally, how do social contexts shape user experiences?
* What potentials for positive experiences can we find in the social world?
* How can we include social context in design processes to create better
  things?

We invite both experts and novices to join us and learn together (see [how to
participate](/aips/participate.html)). If you already have some experience
designing or researching technology for social contexts, we would like to hear
what you have to share. As a novice, you can bring your questions or use cases,
or just get inspired by others' projects. In addition, we share some of our own
work and thoughts. To round off the workshop, we are currently reach out to an
external **keynote** speaker (to be announced).

We are preparing for both an online and an in person scenario of the workshop
and we will keep you informed as soon as we know more. Here are some key
information we do already know:

<p>Application Deadline: 21.05.2021<br>
Dates of the Conference: 05.-08.09.2021</p>

We are looking forward to your contributions! If in doubt, don't hesitate to
[reach out to us](/aips/contact.html).
