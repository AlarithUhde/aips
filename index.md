Welcome to our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="https://muc2021.mensch-und-computer.de">Mensch und Computer</a> workshop
on Interaction in the Public: Aesthetics, Social Acceptability, and Social
Context. We want to bring together HCI researchers and UX practitioners to
discuss the role of "the social" in current design approaches, and to develop
new directions for the future. In addition, we are happy to announce that <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="http://juliericowilliamson.com">Dr.  Julie R Williamson</a> from
University of Glasgow will join us as our invited guest speaker.  She has
published several impactful papers on technology interactions in public spaces
and we are looking forward to her talk at our workshop!

The topics we would like to discuss include:
* How does interaction design shape social experiences?
* More generally, how do social contexts shape user experiences?
* What potentials for positive experiences can we find in the social world?
* How can we include social context in design processes to create better
  things?

We have already received several interesting contributions that cover an wide
range of social contexts. Although the contributor slots are full, you can still
join us as a regular participant and take part in our interactive session. Both
experts and novices are welcome to join us and learn together (see the [call for
participation](/aips/participate.html)).

The Covid situation is still quite unpredictable in Germany. We have considered
several options for the workshop, but finally we decided to run this workshop
completely online. This allows everyone to participate at minimal health risks.
It also allows us to continue planning and to set a date for the workshop:

<p><b>Date of the Workshop: 05.09.2021, 11:00-15:00 CEST</b></p>

If in doubt, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](/aips/contact.html).

We are looking forward to your exciting contributions,
