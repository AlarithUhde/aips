Welcome to our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="https://muc2021.mensch-und-computer.de">Mensch und Computer</a> workshop
on Interaction in the Public: Aesthetics, Social Acceptability, and Social
Context. We want to bring together HCI researchers and UX practitioners to
discuss the role of "the social" in current design approaches, and to develop
new directions for the future. In addition, we are happy to announce that <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="http://juliericowilliamson.com">Dr.  Julie R Williamson</a> from
University of Glasgow will join us as our invited guest speaker.  She has
published several impactful papers on technology interactions in public spaces
and we are looking forward to her talk at our workshop!

The topics we would like discuss include:
* How does interaction design shape social experiences?
* More generally, how do social contexts shape user experiences?
* What potentials for positive experiences can we find in the social world?
* How can we include social context in design processes to create better
  things?

We have already received several interesting contributions that cover an wide
range of social contexts. Although the contributor slots are full, you can still
join us as a regular participant and take part in our interactive session. Both
experts and novices are welcome to join us and learn together (see the [call for
participation](/aips/participate.html)).

The Covid situation is improving quickly in Germany, but there are still some
uncertainties that we have no control of. We are preparing for both an online
and an in person scenario of the workshop and we will keep you informed as soon
as we know more. Here are some key information we already know:

<p><b>Dates of the Conference: 05.-08.09.2021</b> (exact date of the workshop is not set yet)</p>

If in doubt, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](/aips/contact.html).

We are looking forward to your exciting contributions,
