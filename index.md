Welcome to our Mensch und Computer workshop on Interaction in Public Spaces:
Aesthetics, Social Acceptability, and Social Context. We want to explore the
largely untouched questions of positive technology interaction in social spaces
beyond social acceptability, and to work out how this can improve the design
process. Instead of position papers, we ask our participants to contribute
a technology and context profile (from past/present work or conceptual), which
we will explore, mix, and contrast together (see [details](/aips/participate.html)).
Please also have a look at our original [Call for Participation](/assets/cfp.pdf).

The workshop will take place during the Mensch und Computer conference (some
time between 5-8 September 2021) in Ingolstadt, Germany (but we are also
planning with an online backup). If the outcomes are substantial enough, we
plan to publish them in a shared format together with interested participants.

This workshop is part of the project "Aesthetics of Performative Interaction
for Pervasive Computing Environments in Public Spaces", funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) â€“ (Grant No.
425827565) and is part of Priority Program SPP2199 Scalable Interaction
Paradigms for Pervasive Computing Environments.
