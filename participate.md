## General Information

We offer two different ways to participate: As a contributor or as a regular
participant. You might also be interested in our original [workshop
proposal](/aips/assets/proposal.pdf) to learn more about the workshop motivation.

<p>Application Deadline: 21.05.2021<br>
Feedback: early/mid June<br>
Deadline for Abstracts (contributors only): 02.07.2021<br>
Conference: 05.-08.09.2021</p>

### Contributors

>"I have some experiences with social contexts and technologies that I want to
>share!"

As a contributor, you will have time to present and discuss your experiences
during the workshop. Contributions can include (but are not limited to):

* (preliminary) results of your research about social contexts / social
  acceptability
* experiences and lessons learned from designing for social contexts
* methods and design approaches for public settings
* summarizing perspectives about previous work in the social space, or
  developments in research and practice over time
* aesthetics of social interaction

These are our suggestions - if you have an idea that you think fits with the
general theme of the workshop, submit it or [reach out to
us](/aips/contact.html).

As a contributor, a summary of your presentation will be included in the
proceedings of Mensch und Computer as part of the workshop paper. Please let us
know if some of the information from your presentation should not appear in the
proceedings (e.g., in case you work in the private sector and need to comply with limited disclosure agreements).

#### How to apply

Please fill out the form and include a (textual) summary of your presentation
(1-2 pages). You can also include an optional case sheet for the interactive
session.

### Participants

>"I am interested in the topic and I would like to learn from others!"

This is the "light" form of participation: You will get an introduction to
others' work and experiences with social acceptability and the impact of social
contexts on user experiences. During the workshop, you will have time to
exchange ideas and experiences with other participants, contributors, and the
organizers. You will also have an opportunity to work on specific questions or
problems that relate to your work or interests.

#### How to apply

Please fill out the form. If you have a specific case that you would like to
talk about in the interactive session, you can include an optional case sheet.
