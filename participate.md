### Participants

>"I am interested in the topic and I would like to learn from others!"

This is the "light" form of participation: You will get an introduction to
others' work and experiences with social acceptability and the impact of social
contexts on user experiences. During the workshop, you will have time to
exchange ideas and experiences with other participants, contributors, and the
organizers. You will also have an opportunity to work on specific questions or
problems that relate to your work or interests.

#### How to apply

Please fill out the [form](/aips/assets/ApplicationForm.docx) and the [case
sheet](/aips/assets/CaseSheet.docx) with a description of a technology you
frequently use in social spaces, or one that you are working on.
