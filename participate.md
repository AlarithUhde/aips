## Contributors

>"I have some experiences with social contexts and technologies that I want to
>share!"

We are listening! As a contributor, you will have time to present and discuss
your experiences during the workshop. Contributions can include:

* (preliminary) results of your research about social contexts / social
  acceptability
* technology experiences in extraordinary social contexts, or across multiple
  contexts, or with extraordinary technologies
* summarizing perspectives about previous work in the social space, or
  developments over time
* approaches to include social context in the design process
* aesthetics of social interaction

These are only suggestions. If you have an idea that fits with the general
theme of the workshop, submit it or [reach out to us](/aips/contact.html).

Your contribution will be included in the proceedings of Mensch und Computer as
part of the workshop paper.

## Participants

>"I am interested in the topic and I would like to learn from others!"

This is the "light" form of participation: You will get an introduction to
social acceptability and the impact of social contexts on user experiences.
During the workshop, you will have time to exchange ideas and experiences with
other participants, contributors, and the organizers. You will also have an
opportunity to work on specific questions or problems that relate to your work
or interests.
